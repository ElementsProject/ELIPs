This repository contains Elements Improvement Proposals, or ELIPs. The ELIP approval process is largely modeled after the Bitcoin BIP process: we will be liberal in accepting ELIPs, provided that they are documented clearly and completely. Approval of an ELIP, including assignment of a number, does not constitute approval on technical grounds by any Elements Project developer or anyone else; it only indicates that the proposal is clearly written and some consensus has been achieved on what it does.

People wishing to submit ELIPs by do so simply by opening a PR to this repo; discussion may happen in the comments. We do not have a mailing list on which to have discussion prior to opening a PR.

Having an ELIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.
